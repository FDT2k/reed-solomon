# reed-solomon
Reed-Solomon erasure coding in pure Javascript with an optional C++ binding for multi-core throughput. A port of the [JavaReedSolomon](https://github.com/Backblaze/JavaReedSolomon) library released by [Backblaze](http://backblaze.com). For an introduction to erasure coding, see the post by Brian Beach on the [Backblaze blog](https://www.backblaze.com/blog/reed-solomon/). Special thanks to [Backblaze](http://backblaze.com).

## License
`reed-solomon` is licensed under the [MIT License](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_License), which means that you can use it in your own projects for free. You can even use it in commercial projects.

## Installation

#### Linux, OS X
This will compile the native binding automatically:
```
npm install reed-solomon
```

#### Windows
This will skip compiling the native binding automatically:
```
npm install --ignore-scripts reed-solomon
```

## Efficiency
Data redundancy is typically achieved through mirroring or replication at a cost of 3x the original data. With Reed-Solomon erasure codes, you can achieve better redundancy at a cost of only 1.5x the original data. Various storage efficiencies of 1.4x and 1.18x are also possible. You can trade storage efficiency, redundancy and recovery time by fine-tuning the number of data shards and parity shards you use.

## Performance
`reed-solomon` includes a Javascript binding as well as an optional native binding. The native binding executes asynchronously in Node's threadpool for multi-core throughput and scalability without blocking the event loop:

## Native Binding (Optional)
The native binding will be installed automatically when installing `reed-solomon` without the `--ignore-scripts` argument. The Javascript binding will be used if the native binding could not be compiled or is not available. To compile the native binding manually after installing `reed-solomon`, install [node-gyp](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-gyp) globally:
```
sudo npm install node-gyp -g
```
Then build the binding from within the `reed-solomon` module directory:
```
cd node_modules/reed-solomon
node-gyp rebuild
```

## Usage

#### Adjust threadpool size and control concurrency
Please see the [`crypto-async`](https://github.com/jorangreef/crypto-async#adjust-threadpool-size-and-control-concurrency) module for advice on adjusting threadpool size and controlling concurrency.

#### Encoding Parity Shards
```javascript
var ReedSolomon = require('reed-solomon');

// Specify the number of data shards (<=30):
var dataShards = 6;

// Specify the number of parity shards (<=30):
var parityShards = 3; // Protect against loss of any 3 data or parity shards.

// The total number of shards must be at most 31:
var totalShards = dataShards + parityShards;

// Specify the total length of each shard in bytes:
var shardLength = 1024 * 1024;

var buffer = Buffer.concat([
  // Non-ReedSolomon header data:
  <Buffer (16)>,
  // Data shards:
  <Buffer (shardLength)>,
  <Buffer (shardLength)>,
  <Buffer (shardLength)>,
  <Buffer (shardLength)>,
  <Buffer (shardLength)>,
  <Buffer (shardLength)>,
  // Parity shards:
  <Buffer (shardLength)>,
  <Buffer (shardLength)>,
  <Buffer (shardLength)>,
  // Non-ReedSolomon footer data:
  <Buffer (...)>
]);

// Specify the offset into the buffer at which shards begin:
// This allows you to include non-ReedSolomon header data in the buffer.
var bufferOffset = 16;

// Specify the size after this offset of all shards:
// This allows you to include non-ReedSolomon footer data in the buffer.
var bufferSize = shardLength * totalShards;

// Specify the offset into each shard from which to encode/decode:
// This allows you to include non-ReedSolomon header data in each shard.
var shardOffset = 0;

// Specify the size after this offset:
// This allows you to include non-ReedSolomon footer data in each shard.
var shardSize = shardLength - shardOffset;

// Instantiate a ReedSolomon instance:
// This can be used concurrently across many `encode()`/`decode()` calls.
var rs = new ReedSolomon(dataShards, parityShards);

// Encode all parity shards:
rs.encode(
  buffer,
  bufferOffset,
  bufferSize,
  shardLength,
  shardOffset,
  shardSize,
  function(error) {
    if (error) throw error;
    // Parity shards now contain parity data.
  }
);
```

#### Decoding Corrupted Shards
```javascript
// Corrupt data shard at index 0:
buffer[bufferOffset + (shardLength * 0) + shardOffset] = 255;
// Corrupt parity shard at index 8:
buffer[bufferOffset + (shardLength * 8) + shardOffset] = 255;
// We still have enough parity to corrupt another shard.

// Specify every corrupted shard according to its index in the array:
// If a corrupted shard is not specified, the result will be wrong.
var targets = 0;
targets |= (1 << 0); // Data shard at index 0 needs to be decoded.
targets |= (1 << 8); // Parity shard at index 8 needs to be decoded.

// Decode the corrupted data and parity shards:
rs.decode(
  buffer,
  bufferOffset,
  bufferSize,
  shardLength,
  shardOffset,
  shardSize,
  targets,
  function(error) {
    if (error) throw error;
    // Data shard at index 0 has been repaired.
    // Parity shard at index 8 has been repaired.
  }
);
```
